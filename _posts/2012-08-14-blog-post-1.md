Thanks to HKU for giving me the opportunity to work in this lovely university. I had a great and memorable time there, which marked my first step into research. Throughout this valuable internship, I realized that what truly mattered to me during this period were the connections I formed with a group of friends who shared my passion and ambition. This is a crucial factor motivating me to pursue research further, as it enables me to make friends who share the same passions and interests.
