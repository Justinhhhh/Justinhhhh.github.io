<br />

I'm a final year computer science student from NTU, Singapore. 

My research primarily focuses on Natural Language Processing and Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs). The overarching goal of my work is to bridge the gap in understanding the existing capabilities and limitations of LLMs while enhancing them to improve human experiences through safe and reliable AI tools.

I was fortunate to study and work at different universities and in various places. It has been my honor to meet incredible people from all over the world, and I am grateful to have been supervised by [Prof.Cui](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~heming/), [Dr.Song](https://sites.google.com/view/yutingsong/home), [Dr.Lin](https://thomaslin1990.github.io) and [Prof.Stephan](https://ambientintelligence.aalto.fi/team_stephan.php).

You can find more details in my CV here: [Zhiguang's CV](../assets/CV.pdf)

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you have a great day! <:
