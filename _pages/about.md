I'm a third year undergraduate student from NTU. My research interest lies in computer vision, Natural Language Processing and Trustworthy AI.
I did my summer research at The University of Hong Kong under the supervision of [Prof.Cui](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~heming/), and completed my winter internship at A\*STAR IHPC Department under the supervision of [Dr.Song](https://sites.google.com/view/yutingsong/home). Currently, I'm working as a research intern at the A\*STAR I2R Department mentored by [Dr.Lin](https://thomaslin1990.github.io), and a remote intern at CISPA supervised by [Prof.Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/).
